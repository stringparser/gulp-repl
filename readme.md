Simple repl for gulp compatible with gulp#3.x and the future gulp#4.x.

### usage

```js
// gulpfile example
var gulp = require('gulp');
var repl = require('gulp-repl');

gulp.task('foo', function (cb) {
	// do foo stuff
	cb();
});

gulp.task('bar', function (cb) {
	// do bar stuff
	cb();
});

gulp.task('default');
```

Then, on your terminal, you'll have a repl

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to see the prompt
1. write the tasks you want to run
1. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> for completion

```
$ gulp
... some task logging here
(press Enter)
> (press Tab to see completion)
foo      bar      default
> foo bar
[10:39:11] Starting 'foo'...
[10:39:11] Finished 'foo' after 13 μs
[10:39:11] Starting 'bar'...
[10:39:11] Finished 'bar' after 5.52 μs
```
